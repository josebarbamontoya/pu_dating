The RelTime-JA method combines little bootstraps resampling (Sharma and Kumar 2021), maximum likelihood estimation, and RelTime (Tamura et al. 2012; Tamura et al. 2018) approaches for simultaneously inferring evolutionary relationships, divergence times, and confidence intervals incorporating phylogeny uncertainty. The general explanation of RelTime is given in Barba-Montoya et al. (2023), with more detail on  the LBS method given in Sharma and Kumar (2021), and on the RRF given in Tamura et al. (2018). The LBS-RelTime method has three steps, (step 1) LBS-ML analysis, (step 2) relaxed clock dating analysis, and (step 3) timetree construction. The method uses for input a multiple sequence alignment (nucleotide or protein), calibrations, and control/script files that contain the instructions for LBS (Sharma and Kumar 2021), IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015), MEGA-CC (Kumar et al. 2012), and R functions (R Core Team 2022). It is assumed that you have some basic knowledge of using the command line in Unix systems (e.g., MacOS and Linux). You need to download and install LBS, IQ-TREE, MEGA-CC, and R from the links below. Please follow the instructions in the websites to install the programs.
